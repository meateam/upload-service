  misspell:
    # Correct spellings using locale preferences for US or UK.
    # Default is to use a neutral variety of English.
    # Setting locale to US will correct the British spelling of 'colour' to 'color'.

    # max line length, lines longer will be reported. Default is 120.
    # '\t' is counted as 1 character by default, and can be changed with the tab-width option

    # tab width in spaces. Default to 1.

  prealloc:
    # XXX: we don't recommend using this linter before doing performance profiling.
    # For most programs usage of prealloc will be a premature optimization.

    # Report preallocation suggestions only on simple loops that have no returns/breaks/continues/gotos in them.
    # True by default.
    simple: true
    range-loops: false # Report preallocation suggestions on range loops, true by default
